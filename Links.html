        <p>If our intelligent aliens existed only during the time of the dinosaurs on Earth, it is not much good to us. This leaves us with an estimate of four intelligent alien civilisations in our galaxy with a means to communicate and overlapping in time with humans. Even then, communicating across space is a massive challenge. For instance, the Voyager 1 spacecraft, which has been carrying a recording of greetings from Earth on its travels through the solar system since 1977, is only just about to leave the solar system behind and head for deep space. Previous research has found almost half of Britons believe in little green men.The poll of more than 2,000 for the Royal Society found 44 per cent were of the opinion that extra-terrestrial life exists. Interest in life but not as we know it does not end there, with more than a third of those questioned saying we should be actively searching and trying to make contact with ET.</p>
